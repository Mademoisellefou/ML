## About The Project

Hello my name is melany this is interesting aplication of machine learning almost 700 people survived but in this data we register 342 ,the most imprt is understand the data behavior
Important topics:
1 Scalers

2 Value counts

3 Missing data

4 correlations of some features

Explore interesting themes
1 Rich people survive more?

2 Female survive more?, what about kids and old people

3 How the fare payment affects the survival

4 Your title name affects your chances to survive

Here's why:

- We should be focused on what kind of problem is it ,this binary classification.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You find out this dataset in https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

### Prerequisites

- npm

```sh
Sklearn
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

<!-- ROADMAP -->

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

<!-- LICENSE -->

## algorithms

why use these algorithms
AdaBootsClassifier learning by making use of decision trees, the information in our dataset collected at each stage of the algorithm AdaBoost on the relative 'hardness' of each training sample is fed into the tree growth algorithm so later trees tend to focus on the hardest to classify.
Logistic Regression Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass / fail, which is represented by an indicator variable.
Random Forest gives us estimates of which variables are important in the classification.
